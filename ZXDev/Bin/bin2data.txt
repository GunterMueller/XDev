
Introduction:
    bin2data takes a Spectrum machine code program and generates an auto-executing TAP or TZX file.

Usage:
    bin2data [options] "input file" "output file" "program name"

    "input file" specifies the machine code program to insert into the output file.
    "output file" is the name of the tape image to create. The extension (TAP or TZX) specifies the tape format.
    "program name" specifies the Spectrum program name given to the tape image.

Options:
    -data:  Inserts the machine code program as a series of DATA statements along with code to READ and POKE the data.

    -rem:   Inserts the machine code program into a REM statement.

    -org:   Specify the origin address of the code as the next command line argument after this option.
            This is required if -data is given and optional for -rem.
            When given for the -rem option, a code stub is inserted to copy the code from the REM statement to the specified address.
            A CLEAR <org - 1> will be inserted into the BASIC program unless org is below 24000.

    -txt:   Applicable only for tape images created using the -data option, this option creates a plain text file version of the BASIC program.
            Specify the text filename as the next command line argument after this option, ie: -txt "myprog.txt"
