XDev
====
XDev is open and free set of compilers, additional tools, libraries and design patterns
for cross-platform and embedded development in modular programming languages.

You can develop projects in several languages at once.
You can develop for different platforms, such as retro and new.

XDev/ZXDev
==========
ZXDev is a XDev subsystem for target platform Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48K (based on CPU Z80).

Documentation: ZXDev/Docu
Forum: http://zx.oberon2.ru/forum/viewforum.php?f=10


Supported languages, platforms and translations schemes
=======================================================

Oberon, Oberon-2 =>[Ofront]=> C =>[SDCC]=> ZX Spectrum TRD (TR-DOS image)
C =>[SDCC]=> ZX Spectrum TRD (TR-DOS image)
Z80 assembly =>[SDCC]=> ZX Spectrum TRD (TR-DOS image)

Oberon, Oberon-2, Component Pascal => BlackBox => Win32 native machine code (EXE, DLL)

Oberon, Oberon-2, Component Pascal => BlackBox => Linux i386 native machine code (SO)


Now I'm working on adding to support the platform J2ME.

To reduce the significance of the development environment, as well as difference of dialects, the cross-platform libraries would be all the same common for different platforms and different languages.

I'm sorry, but mainly project documentation is in Russian. I hope, if you really interested in this project, it's will not be a problem. You can read it with help of multi-language Google translator.

I am interested in supporting other platforms in various ways, in adding new libraries, tools and compilers for these platforms. Therefore the project needs maintainers of the new platforms. Also the project XDev needs a maintainer of the project's branch in English.


Main goals and benefits of XDev
===============================
Simplicity,
Reliability,
Small size of the target machine code,
The widely using of the great achievements of the European school of programming, such as safe and modular programming languages - Oberon, Oberon-2, Component Pascal.
